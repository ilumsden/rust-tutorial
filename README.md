# Rust Tutorial

This is an introductory tutorial I put together on the Rust programming language. This tutorial has multiple sessions covering the following topics:

1. Session 1:
   1. What is Rust, and why should you use it?
   2. Language Rules
2. Session 2:
   1. "Object Oriented" Rust
   2. Enums
3. Session 3:
   1. Modules and Rust Editions
   2. Intro to Some Important Advanced Features
  
Each session has accompioning code that can (mostly) by found in the `RustTutorial.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To use this notebook, you must have the _evcxr_ Jupyter kernel for Rust. Instructions for installing this kernel can be found on [the _evcxr_ kernel GitHub](https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md) or in the slide deck in this repo.
